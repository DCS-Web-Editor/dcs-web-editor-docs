## Editor

Q: The DCSmaps DCSM map layer isnt loading or shows grey tiles.  
A: It only works in the Caucasus area. For some browsers you may need to enable mixed content for the editor website, as dcsmaps tiles are served over http not https. You can also enable mixed content (just for this website) in Chrome. This allows it to load images over http, which is necessary until DCSmaps can serve map tiles via https.

Q: Some map layers in DCS Web Viewer aren't working.  
A: Some map layers will show grey tiles as they require a map key. To enable all map layers go to [https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/), sign up for a free account and paste the mapbox key into the field in the menu. Then reload the browser.

Q: Its not working in my browser.  
A: Currently chrome-based browsers work best and have optimal performance. We recommend Chromium (open source Chrome without google). Second best are other Chromium-based browsers such as Chrome, Brave, Edge, Opera, Vivaldi etc.  
Least supported (for now) are ü¶ä Firefox / ü¶è Safari due to differences in their APIs.

- Please post bugs with a screenshot and your OS, browser / version so we can fix it for future releases.  
- If you are using Brave, you may wish to disable Shields for best results.

Q: Is there a way to improve performance?  
A: Yes, use the recommended browsers‚Å† and in map layers:

- disable all üê¢üê¢ (very slow) and maybe üê¢(slow) and enable all üöÄ(fast)  
- disable ad blockers or other browser extensions that interfere with the DOM / website, they can slow down this app quite significantly

Q: The font is too small.  
A: This will be configurable later. For now, you can use the browser keys Ctrl + - or Cmd + - on mac.
