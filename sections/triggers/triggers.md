## Triggers & Zones

**Work in progress**

![Triggers](./images/Triggers.png)  
  
The first element of the Triggers panel is the Trigger Rules button:  
![TriggerRules](./images/TriggerRules.png)  
  
This window allows the user to upload trigger rules in .json format.  
  
Zone List:  
![ZoneList](./images/ZoneList.png)  
  
This window is similar in layout to the ones we covered before, so let's go over the main section: 
- Zone Name displays the zone, as well as it's color.
- ID is a unique identifier number.
- Radius displays the size of the zone, in meters.
- Properties displays the amount of property key-value pairs assigned to that zone.
- Type shows the type zone, circle or polygon.
- Hidden once again shows whether the unit is hidden or shown.  
  
Next are the Circle and Polygon buttons. These buttons are utilized to place the respective zones.

## Zone Panel

On the panel is also a slider to increase/decrease the size of the zone.
